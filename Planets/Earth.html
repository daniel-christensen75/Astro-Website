                    Earth is the third planet from the sun and the largest of the inner planets. It is currently the only known planet
                    in the solar system that can maintain life and has oceans. 70% of the Earth's surface is water. Our home planet
                    is also one of the most geologically active planets in the solar system. The landscape is among the most diverse
                    with mountains, valleys, plains, canyons, and even craters that break through the atmosphere. The atmosphere is
                    mostly made up of nitrogen, but it also has enough oxygen to allow for life. Since Earth is still one of the closest
                    planets to the sun, it is in danger of solar radiation from the sun. Luckily the Earth has a strong magnetic field that
                    absorbs solar radiation and protects life down on the surface.
