                <p>
                    Jupiter is the fifth and largest planet in the solar system. It is the first of the gas giants, and follows after
                    the astroid belt that separates the terrestrial planets and the gas giants. It is covered in different colored stripes,
                    and has a big red spot. The stripes come from the different elements that make up Jupiter's atmosphere. The atmosphere is
                    made up of several different layers, and each set of stripes is actually at a different height from one another. The giant
                    red spot is a severe storm that has been ravaging the planet for hundreds of years. Jupiter is so large that nearly 100 Earths
                    could fit inside it. However, anything that crosses Jupiter's clouds is instantly crushed because of the high pressure from it's
                    atmosphere. Jupiter also has rings, but they are too faint to see without special equipment.
