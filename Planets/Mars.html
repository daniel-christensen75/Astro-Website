                    Mars is the fourth planet from the sun. It is half the size of Earth. It is hypothesized that Mars once looked like
                    Earth, but it's core cooled down and the surface was wiped away from solar radiation. Mars has been receiving a lot of
                    attention lately as possibly being the first planet for humans to land on. Eventually, people like Elon Musk are wanting
                    to colonize the planet and terraform it, or make it like Earth again. However, currently Mars is too cold and dry to maintain
                    life. Mars has seasons like Earth does, but it does not have as dense of an atmosphere, meaning that heat cannot be cantained
                    easily. It's atmosphere is mostly made up of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon, so humans would need air tanks if they
                    wanted to breathe oxygen. Mars has the biggest canyon in the solar system called Valles Marineris which runs along its
                    equator.
