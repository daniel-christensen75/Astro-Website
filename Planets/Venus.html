                     Venus is the second closest planet to the sun. While it is not the closest, it is the hottest with an average temperature
                     of 864 degrees Fahrenheit (462 degrees Celsius). This is because of Venus' thick atmosphere which is mostly made up of
                     the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. Venus is so hot that many spacecraft have melted shortly after landing on the surface.
                     Our neighboring planet has clouds like Earth does, but they are made up of sulfur instead of water vapor. Some have thought
                     about trying to colonize Venus by landing large balloons on the dense clouds have a cloud city. However, humans would still
                     not be able to breath on the planet, and it would be more challenging than colonizing
                     our other neighboring planet, Mars.
