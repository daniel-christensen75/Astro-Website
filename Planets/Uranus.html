                <p>
                    Uranus is the seventh planet from the sun. Uranus is unique because it is the only planet in the solar system
                    that rotates on its side. This is thought to be caused by an impact early in the planet's formation that knocked
                    it 90 degrees on its side. Uranus is also sets itself apart from Jupiter and Saturn because it's mostly made up
                    of ice rather than gas. In fact, Uranus and Neptune are recently being called <em>ice giants</em> instead of gas
                    giants because of this difference. Because it is mostly made up of ice, Uranus is the second least dense planet
                    in the solar system. This means that if you were to land on the surface, you would weigh 10% less on Uranus than
                    you would on Earth.
