                <p>
                    Saturn is the sixth planet from the sun, and the second largest. It is mostly known for its larger
                    rings that wrap around the planet. The rings are made up of chunks of ice that orbit at different velocities
                    and distances around the planet. The rings are thought to be from moons that crashed together, and the remnants
                    are now what orbits the planet. One of the first discoveries about Saturn is that it's ring is actually made up of
                    many other small rings, called ringlets. Many spacecraft have made the journey out to Saturn, but the most impactful
                    spacecraft was Cassini who captured hundreds of images of Saturn and discovered 7 new moons. Cassini's mission ended
                    in 2017 when it took a plunge into Saturn's atmosphere.
